- When measuring displays which have a high level of view angle

dependability, measurement reproducibility will be higher if the
installation angle θ of the measuring probe is kept constant for all

measurements.

- Use of the hood (standard accessory) not only prevents entry of envi
ronmental light but also makes it easy to place the instrument at the
specified distance and perpendicular to the object.

#### **About Installation**

The operating environmental requirements are given in the “Specifications” of this manual. The instrument must

be installed in a place that completely meets these requirements. (Page 110-113)

**<Notes on Installation>**

- Using the instrument in direct sunshine in midsummer or near a heater will cause a rapid rise in its temperature

resulting in breakdown.

Special care must be taken when handling the instrument in such an environment. In addition, take care not to

allow the vents to become blocked. Do not use the instrument in poorly ventilated areas.

- Do not use the instrument in a place where the temperature changes rapidly, since measured values will be

incorrect.

- The instrument must not be used in areas where there is an excessive amount of dust or where the humidity is

excessively high.

- The instrument must not be used if foreign matter such as water and metal objects enter it, doing so is very

dangerous.

- The AC power cord must not be pulled or bent excessively nor must excessive force be exerted on it. Doing so

may result in wire breakage.

- The AC power cord must not be connected to an AC line on which excessive noise is present.

- If any irregularity or abnormality is found, turn OFF(●) the power immediately, disconnect the AC power

cord, and refer to “Troubleshooting Guide” on page 107.

**25**



--- PAGE 28 ---

#### **About Connection**

**1. Connectin** **a Measurin** **Probe**
**g** **g**

Before setting the POWER switch to ON ( | ), a measuring probe must be connected to the probe connector [P1] on

the instrument.

**[Connecting Method]**


**1** **.** **Set the POWER switch to OFF (“** O **” position).**

**2** **.** **Insert the probe’s plug into the probe connector**

**[P1], with the probe serial no. facing down.**

**3** **.** **Check that the plug is inserted all the way and**
**connected firmly**

   - When disconnecting the measuring probe, set the POWER
switch to OFF(●) first, and pull the probe by holding the

plug. Never pull the probe by its cord.

**<Notes when Connecting the Probe>**

- Never connect or remove the measuring probe while the POWER

switch is ON ( | ).

- When connecting/disconnecting the measuring probe, always hold

the plug and connect/disconnect it. In addition, do not pull or bend

the cord excessively or exert excessive force on it. Doing so may

result in wire breakage.

- The Measuring Luminance Range will vary according to the type

of Measuring Probe.

- When measurement is implemented, the same Measuring Probe

to be used for the User Calibration is necessary. If measurement

is carried out by connecting the different Measuring Probe, error

message E1 will be displayed.

**<Notes on Zero Calibration>**



- If the luminance of the display to be measured is 1.0 cd/m 2 or less (if LED Universal Measuring ø10 Probe(CA
PSU32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35), 3.0 cd/m 2 or less), perform zero calibration



- If the luminance of the display to be measured is 1.0 cd/m


PSU32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35), 3.0 cd/m 2 or less), perform zero calibration

after elapse of 30 minutes or more after the POWER switch is set to ON.
When measuring such a low-luminance display for a long period of time, perform zero calibration approximately every hour.

- Perform zero calibration if the ambient temperature has changed.

- Zero calibration can be performed anytime even if “PUSH 0-CAL KEY” is not displayed.

- Never direct the measuring probe toward the illuminant with illuminance exceeding the measurement range

during zero calibration.

- Never press any keys during zero calibration. Doing so will cause completion of zero calibration to take more

time.

- ~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4-Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA-B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

Zero calibration will be performed simultaneously with all the connected measuring probes.

**[Operating Procedure]**

   - Don ’ t turn the tip of Probe to a high illuminant-brightness light source with illuminance exceeding the measure
ment range.


~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

#### **Outline of the Settings Section+**

This section explains settings that must be made according to measurement method.

Available measurement methods and the settings that must be made are explained below.

**<Measurement by Konica Minolta’s Calibration Standard>**

With this method, measurement is performed using Konica Minolta’s calibration standard without calibration.

Even if you are setting the target color to the memory channel CH00, measurement must be performed as ex
plained below.

**It is not necessary to set/change the target color if you are not going to use the analog display function.**

**[Operating Procedure]**








- To set an ID name : “Setting an ID Name” (Page 67) *2

- To use the analog display function: “Setting an Analog Display Range” (Page 69) *3

**<Measurement by User Calibration>**

With this method, user calibration is performed and the obtained correction factor is used for measurement.

Since the target color is also set, the analog display section can show the deviation of the measured values from the

target color. User calibration must be performed in the following cases. (However, it is not possible to perform user

calibration using the memory channel CH00.)

- To correct variation of readings that occur due to the deviation of spectral sensitivity from the CIE 1931 color
matching function

- To correct difference of readings between instruments when two or more instruments are used

- Correction of difference of readings between measuring probes when two or more probes are used

**[Operating Procedure]**






- Details of user calibration : “About User Calibration” (Page 51)

- To change the target color after user calibration: “Setting/Changing the Target Color” (Page 62) *1

- To set an ID name : “Setting an ID Name” (Page 67) *2

- To use the analog display function : “Setting an Analog Display Range” (Page 69) *3

46



--- PAGE 49 ---

**<Measurement by Analyzer Mode>**

With this method, the measured colors are expressed in emission intensity of each R, B and G monochromatic light

based on the display’s analyzer mode RGB emission characteristic (which is input to the instrument’s memory

channel) and the target color (W).

Since the target color is also set, the analog display section can show the deviation of the measured values from the

target color. If this method is used when adjusting display’s white balance, the adjustment can be performed more

easily than xyLv mode.

**[Operating Procedure]**






- Details of analyzer mode : “About Analyzer Mode” (Page 58)

- To change the target color after the analyzer

mode RGB emission characteristic is input : “Setting/Changing the Target Color” (Page 62) *1

- To set an ID name : “Setting an ID Name” (Page 67) *2

- To use the analog display function : “Setting an Analog Display Range” (Page 69) *3

***1 About “Setting/Changing the Target Color”**

There are the following two methods for setting/changing the target color.
1 Setting/changing the target ...................... The display’s measured values are set as the target color.

color by measurement This method can be used for any memory channels.
2 Setting/changing the target color ............. Set the desired values (x, y, Lv) by entering them directly using the

by entering values instrument’s number-key. This method can be used for memory chan
nel CH00 only.

***2 About “Setting an ID Name”**

An ID name is a name that can be assigned to each memory channel by entering it directly using keys.

This function is useful when you want to specify that user calibration and target color have been set for what type

of display with what colors.

***3 About “Setting an Analog Display Range”**

Adjustment is performed by setting the analog display range for each dot.

- To check the specified target color, calibration data for user calibration and probe serial no. used when these settings are made, refer to
“Settings Checking Method” on page 73.

--- PAGE 50 ---

#### **Before Making Each Setting**

**1. About Memor** **Channels**
**y**

This instrument has a total of 100 channels (CH00 to CH99).

The following items can be set for each of these channels.


CH00 EXT Ad P1A

[MINOLTA  ]


Memory channel


Probe no.


Probe type


1 Correction factor for user calibration ...........................

[MINOLTA  ]

.................................... (For details, refer to page 51.)

2 RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode .............

.................................... (For details, refer to page 59.)
3 Target color .................... (For details, refer to page 49.)
4 ID name .......................... (For details, refer to page 67.)

CH00 is provided for calibration that uses Konica Minolta’s calibra
tion standard.

For this channel, only the target color, RGB emission characteristic MEMORY CH and keys
for display’s analyzer mode and ID name can be set.

The desired memory channel can be selected by switching from one to another by pressing the MEMORY CH

and keys.

It is also possible to assign an ID name to each memory channel by entering it directly using keys. The ID name is

displayed together with the memory channel no. in the LCD display section.

- If the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is input using a memory channel that has been matrix
calibrated, the correction factor for matrix calibration will be deleted. (If xylv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv or XYZ mea
surement mode is selected, the Konica Minolta’s calibration standard will be used for measurement.)

- In the case of the same memory channels and probes, the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is

stored in their common memory irrespective of measurement mode. Therefore, when matrix calibration is

performed, the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is also input at the same time.

**User Calibration  How the memory is used in the case of analyzer mode**


ID name





~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

**<Relationship between Memory Channels and Probes>**

If the 4-Probe Expansion Board is installed, each probe ([P1] to [P5]) has a total of 100 channels (CH00 to CH99).
The correction factor for user calibration (1), RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode (2) and target color (3) can
be set for each probe. However, ID name (4) is common to all the probes of the same memory channels.

For instance, if the ID name “CRT-001” is assigned to CH01 when the measured values for probe [P1] are displayed,

“CRT-001” will be displayed for CH01 of all the probes [P1] to [P5].

|Probe no.|[P1]|[P2]|[P3]|[P4]|[P5]|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Usable memory channels|CH00 to 99|CH00 to 99|CH00 to 99|CH00 to 99|CH00 to 99|
|ID name (page 65)|CH00 to 99 (Common to all probes)|CH00 to 99 (Common to all probes)|CH00 to 99 (Common to all probes)|CH00 to 99 (Common to all probes)|CH00 to 99 (Common to all probes)|

**2. About the Tar** **et Color**
**g**

The target color is the reference used to measure how much the measured values are deviated from a certain color.

The target color can be set for each probe of each memory channel.

The target color is set when the following is performed.
1 User calibration (page 51) ......................... Performing user calibration sets the calibration values as the target

color.

2 Setting/changing the target color ............... Set or change the target color in the following cases.

(page 62)  - When you want to set the target color for memory channel CH00

                        - When you want to set a color that differs from the color used for user

calibration as the target color to a user-calibrated memory channel

                     - When you want to perform measurement using Konica Minolta’s

calibration standard without user calibration and want to use the

analog display function
3 Inputting the RGB emission .................... When you select analyzer measurement mode and input the RGB

characteristic for analyzer mode emission characteristic for analyzer mode, also set the target color

(page 59) (W).

- Since when calibration factor is input for user calibration/analyzer mode the target color is also set at the same

time, the previously set target color will be deleted.

- To change the currently set target color, change it as explained in “Setting/Changing the Target Color” (page

62). Even if the target color is changed, the currently set correction factor for user calibration and the RGB

emission characteristic for display’s analyzer mode will remain unchanged.

In the case of the same memory channels, the target color is stored in their common memory irrespective of

measurement mode.

As a result, the target color set last will be stored irrespective of how it was set.

In one memory channel and one probe, a correction factor of User Calibration is common to xyLv mode, T∆uvLv

mode, u'v'Lv mode and XYZ mode.

Target color is common to all measuring modes.

calibration standard will be set for CH00 as well as for all the non-user-calibrated memory channels when the

POWER switch is set to ON( | ).

**50**



--- PAGE 53 ---

#### **User Calibration**

**1. About User Calibration**

- User calibration is provided to set the user’s own correction factor to the instrument’s memory channels by

measuring the color of a display and setting the calibration values (x, y, Lv) to the instrument.

Once this factor is set, the values corrected by this factor will be displayed and output each time measurement

is taken.

- This instrument allows two kinds of user calibration; white calibration and matrix calibration.

By default (factory setting), matrix calibration is selected.

- User calibration can be performed for each memory channel. (Except for CH00)

- ~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

User calibration is performed independently for probe ([P1] to [P5]) for each memory channel. (Except for

CH00)

- When this instrument is used for the first time since shipment from the factory, measurement will be performed

based on the calibration carried out by the Konica Minolta’s calibration standard. This applies to all the memory

channels. Once user calibration is performed, the following correction will be made when measurement is

performed using the obtained correction factor.
1 Correction of variation of readings that occur due to the deviation of spectral sensitivity from the CIE 1931

color-matching function
2 Correction of difference of readings between instruments when two or more instruments are used

3 ~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

Correction of difference of readings between measuring probes when two or more probes are used

- At the same time as user calibration is performed for a memory channel, the obtained color will be set as the

target color to that memory channel. The target color is the color used as the reference when displaying how

much the measured values are deviated from a certain color. (Page 49)

- When User Calibration is implemented, the same Measuring Probe to be used for the measurement is necessary.

If measurement is carried out by connecting the different Measuring Probe, error message E1 will be displayed.

In this case, it is necessary to replace it with the Measuring Probe that received User Calibration or you have to

execute User Calibration once again using the Measuring Probe to be used for the measurement.

**<When Two or More Instruments are Used>**

When two or more instruments are used or when the optional 4-Probe Expansion Board CA-B15 is used to perform

measurement with two or more measuring probes, the difference between readings can be corrected if user calibra
tion is performed as explained below.

**When the values of the color to be used as the target are known:**

The color set to the reference display is displayed and user calibration is performed for all the bodies (or measuring

probes).

**When the values of the color to be used as the target are unknown:**

1 Select one master body (or select one master probe).
2 Select “xyLv” measurement mode (page 40), and place the master body’s measuring probe (or the master

probe) against the display on which the target color is displayed.
3 While the probe is placed against the display, press the ~~HOLD~~ key.
4 By using the display on which the target color is displayed and the values displayed at step 3, perform user

calibration for the other bodies (or measuring probes).

**51**



--- PAGE 54 ---

**2. Performin** **White Calibration**
**g**

- User calibration cannot be performed with the memory channel CH00.

(CH00 memory channel is provided for measurement that uses the Konica Minolta’s calibration standard.)

- White calibration must be performed for each display type (model).

Characters of displays vary with the display type (model). Because of this, measured values differ even if the

same color is measured. Thus, a different memory channel must be used for each display type (model) to

perform white calibration.

- If white calibration is performed with a memory channel to which the target color has already been set, that

target color will be deleted.

- If white calibration is performed with a memory channel which has already been matrix-calibrated, the correc
tion factor of the previous matrix calibration will be deleted and the correction factor obtained from the white

calibration will be set.

**3. Performin** **Matrix Calibration**
**g**

- Matrix calibration cannot be performed with the memory channel CH00.

(CH00 memory channel is provided for measurement that uses the Konica Minolta’s calibration standard.)

- Matrix calibration must be performed for each display type (model).

Characters of displays vary with the display type (model). Because of this, measured values differ even if the

same color is measured. Thus, a different memory channel must be used for each display type (model) to

perform matrix calibration.

- If matrix calibration is performed with a memory channel to which the target color has already been set, that

target color will be deleted.

- If matrix calibration is performed with a memory channel which has already been white-calibrated, the correc
tion factor of the previous white calibration will be deleted and the correction factor obtained from the matrix

calibration will be set.

- If matrix calibration is performed with a memory channel for which the RGB emission characteristic for the

analyzer mode is to be set, the previous RGB emission characteristic will be deleted and the WRGB set for

matrix calibration will be set as the RGB emission characteristic.

**<Notes on User Calibration>**

- The target color is also set when user calibration is performed.

Note that the target color is common to all measurement modes (xyLv, T∆uvLv, analyzer, u'v'Lv, XYZ).

- If the intensity of the display to be measured is 1.0 cd/m **[2]** or less (3.0 cd/m [2] or less when a LED Universal

Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PSU32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35) is connected.) or if

the ambient temperature has changed, zero calibration must be performed before user calibration.

- Static electricity on the display’s screen surface must be removed as much as possible.

- Make sure that the measuring probe is placed straight against the display. If it is tilted or moved, user calibra
tion will not be accurate.

- Take care not to let the measuring probe be exposed to excessive impact. Neither should the cord be pulled or

bent excessively nor excessive force be exerted on it. Failure to observe these cautions may result in breakdown

or wire-breakage.

- The key may not be operable if “OVER” is displayed on the LCD display section.

- Never press the following keys during user calibration. Doing so will cancel user calibration and activate the

mode corresponding to the pressed key.

#### **Analyzer Mode**

**1. About Anal** **zer Mode**
**y**

**<What is Analyzer Mode?>**

Analyzer measurement mode is provided for adjustment of the display’s white balance.

The measured colors are expressed in output of each R, B and G monochromatic light based on the display’s

analyzer mode RGB emission characteristic (input to the instrument) and the target color (W).

Thus, adjusting the emission intensity of R causes the measured value of R only to change, and measured values

for B and G remain unchanged This mode is useful when you adjust the emission intensity of R, B and G to match

the target color (W).

The following measured values will be displayed when the display’s emission intensity (emission intensity of R, B

and G monochrome lights) and the target color (W) are set and measurement is performed in analyzer mode.

- Digital display section ............................... R, B, G : Outputs of the currently measured monochrome lights R,

**2.** **In** **uttin** **the RGB Emission Characteristic for Anal** **zer Mode**
**p** **g** **y**

The RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode must be input to each memory channel. When it is input, the

target color (W) must also be set.

To adjust white balance, the values of the white-balanced white must be entered as the terget color (W).

If the RGB emission characteristic for the display’s analyzer mode is input to a memory channel for which the

target color has already been set, the previously set target color will be deleted. The target color to be used is the

same as that for xyLv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv and XYZ measurement modes.

The RGB emission characteristic for the display must be input for each display type (model).

Characters of displays vary with the display type (model). Because of this, measured values differ even if the same

color is measured.

Thus, a different memory channel must be used for each display type (model) to input the RGB emission charac
teristic for analyzer mode.

**<** **Notes on When Inputting the RGB** **Emission** **Characteristic for Analyzer Mode** **>**

- By default (factory setting), the RGB emission characteristic for the display’s analyzer mode has not been

input.

Thus, before performing measurement in analyzer mode, the RGB emission characteristic must be input.

- The target color is also set when the RGB emission characteristic is input.

Note that the target color is common to all measurement modes (xyLv, T∆uvLv, analyzer, u'v'Lv, XYZ).

- If the intensity of the display to be measured is 1.0 cd/m [2] or less (3.0 cd/m [2] or less when a LED Universal

Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PSU32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35) is connected.) or if

the ambient temperature has changed, zero calibration must be performed before inputting the RGB emission

characteristic.

- Static electricity on the display’s screen surface must be removed as much as possible.

- Make sure that the measuring probe is placed against the display. If it is tilted or moved, it is not possible to

input accurate emission characteristic.

- Take care not to let the measuring probe be exposed to excessive impact. In addition, do not pull or bend the

cord excessively or exert excessive force on it. Failure to observe this may result in breakdown or wire-breakage.

- keys may not be operable if “OVER” is displayed on the LCD display section.

- Never press the following keys during setting.

Doing so will cancel setting of the emission characteristic and activate the mode corresponding to the pressed

key.

( 0-CAL, MODE, MR, MEMORY CH,, )

- If the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is input using a memory channel that has been matrix
calibrated, the correction factor for matrix calibration will be deleted. (Konica Minolta’s calibration standard

will be used for measurement if xyLv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv or XYZ measurement mode is selected.)

- In the case of the same memory channels and probes, the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is

stored in their common memory irrespective of measurement mode. Therefore, when matrix calibration is

performed, the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode is also input at the same time.

#### **Setting/Changing the Target Color**

**If you have input the RGB emission characteristic for user calibration/analyzer**
**mode:**

It is not necessary to set the target color in the following cases.
1 When you want to set the user-calibrated color as the target color for a memory channel
2 When you want to set the target color (W) which was set when the RGB emission characteristic for the display’s

analyzer mode was set as the target color

The target color set here is the same as those set by 1 and 2 Only when you want to change the currently set target

color, should it be changed it as explained below.

By setting the target color, the difference between the measured value and the target color can be displayed in the

analog display section. The target color can be set for each probe of each memory channel.

The target color must be set in the following cases.

- When you want to set the target color for memory channel CH00

- When you want to perform measurement using Konica Minolta’s calibration standard without user calibration

and want to use the analog display function

- When you want to set a color that differs from the color used for user calibration as the target color to a user
calibrated memory channel

- ~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~
When you want to set the target color (W) that has already been set and another color as the target color to a

memory channel for which the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode has been input

There are the following two methods of setting/changing the target color. Some memory channels do not allow you

to set the target color.

The analog display section displays the difference (%) between the measured value and the target color as well as
the difference (%) between measured values in the case of a measurement mode other than flicker mode**.In the
case of flicker mode, the measured values will be displayed as they are.
The range for each dot can be set as follows.

1 xyLv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv or XYZ measurement mode ..... ∆x, ∆y and ∆Lv
2 Analyzer Mode
For G-reference .............. R/G, B/G and ∆G

For R-reference............... ∆R, B/R and G/R

3 Flicker Mode** ................... Flicker value

The range must be set independently of 1, 2. and 3
In the case of 1, the range set here will be used commonly by all the modes. Thus, for instance, if ∆x and
∆y are set to 2% and ∆Lv is set to 10% for xyLv mode, ∆x and ∆y will be displayed in 2% and ∆Lv in 10%
irrespective of the measurement mode (xyLv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv or XYZ).
In the case of 2, the value set for ∆G (G-reference), the value set for ∆R (R-reference), the values set for R/
G and B/G (G-reference) and those set for B/R and G/R (R-reference) will be common. Thus, for instance,
if ∆G is set to 5% and both R/G and B/G are set to 3% in the case of G-reference, ∆R will be displayed in 5%

and both B/R and G/R in 3% in the case of R-reference.

In the case of 3, the analog display range for each dot can be set for flicker value.

#### **Settings Checking Method**

**1. Checkin** **the Set Values**
**g**

**<Checking the Specified Target Color>**

By pressing the ~~MR~~ key for less than two seconds in xyLv, T∆uvLv, u'v'Lv or XYZ

mode, the values of the target color for the currently selected memory channel is

displayed in the LCD display section as shown on the right.

~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~
The values of the target color for the currently selected memory channel probe no. will be displayed.

**<Checking the Calibration Values for User Calibration>**

- When white calibration is performed as user calibration

1 If only user calibration has been performed, the calibration values can be checked by checking the target

values. Since when user calibration is performed the color at the time of user calibration will be set as the

target color automatically, the target color values match the calibration values. However, if a different

color is set as the target color after user calibration, it is not possible to check the calibration values with

this method.

2 It is possible to check the calibration value for W by performing steps 5 and 6 ( key→ key) of the

white calibration operating procedure (page 53).

The value that appears first when the key is pressed is the calibration value that was entered when the

previous user calibration was performed. The values for the target color will be displayed if user calibra
tion has not been performed.

- When matrix calibration is performed as user calibration

1 If only user calibration has been performed, the W calibration values can be checked by checking the

target values. Since when user calibration is performed the color at the time of W calibration will be set

as the target color automatically, the target color values match the W calibration values.

However, if a different color is set as the target color after user calibration, it is not possible to check the

calibration values with this method.

2 It is possible to check the calibration value for W by performing steps 5 and 6 ( key→ key) of the

white calibration operating procedure (page 53).

The value that appears first when the key is pressed is the calibration value that was entered when the

previous user calibration was performed. The values for the target color will be displayed if user calibra
tion has not been performed.
3 To check the calibration values for R, G and B, perform steps 4 then 5 ( key→ key), steps 4 then

6 ( key→ key) or steps 4 and then 7 ( key→ key) of the matrix calibration operating

procedure (page 55).

The value that appears first when these keys are pressed is the calibration value that was entered when

the previous user calibration was performed. “0” will be displayed for R, G and B if user calibration has

not been performed.

The measurement results will be displayed in the digital and analog display sections in the selected measurement mode.
**<Notes on Measurement>**

- Since the luminance of the display will be unstable for a while immediately after the display is turned ON, the
measured values must be read after they have stabilized.

- Static electricity on the display’s screen surface must be removed as much as possible.

- Perform zero calibration if the ambient temperature has changed.

- When measuring a display at a low luminance level of 1.0 cd/m [2] or less (3.0 cd/m [2] or less when a LED Universal Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PSU32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35) is connected.)
for a long period of time, perform zero calibration approximately every hour.

- Make sure that the measuring probe is placed straight against the display. If it is tilted or moved, accurate
measurement cannot be performed.

- Take care not to let the measuring probe be exposed to excessive impact. In addition, do not pull or bend the
cord excessively or exert excessive force on it. Failure to observe these cautions may result in breakdown or
wire-breakage.

- When measurement is implemented, the same Measuring Probe to be used for the User Calibration is necessary.

- For measurement of flicker(only when LED Flicker Measuring ø27 Probe(CA-P32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35) is connected.), make sure that the correct vertical synchronizing frequency is
recognized by the instrument. If an incorrect vertical synchronizing frequency is set in the INT mode or instrument is used in the UNIV mode, correct measured values will not be obtained in flicker measurement.

~~When~~ ~~the~~ ~~optional~~ ~~4~~ - ~~Probe~~ ~~Expansion~~ ~~Board~~ ~~CA~~ - ~~B15~~ ~~is~~ ~~used~~

 - If two or more measuring probes are connected, measurement will be performed with all the probes simultaneously. However, the digital and analog display sections show only the measurement results taken by the
one selected probe (page 43).

#### **White Balance Adjustment in Analyzer Mode**

**<About Analyzer Mode>**

Analyzer measurement mode is provided for adjustment of the display’s white balance.

The measured colors are expressed in emission intensity of each R, B and G monochromatic light based on the

RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode (page 59) and the target color (W) which are set to the instrument.

Thus, adjusting the emission intensity of R causes the measured value of R only to change, and measured values

for B and G remain unchanged.

This mode is useful when you adjust the emission intensity of R, B and G to match the target color (W).

**<White Balance Adjustment in Analyzer Mode>**

First, set the RGB emission characteristic for analyzer mode and the target color (W) to the instrument.

For the target color (W), the values of the white-balanced white must be entered. (Page 59)


If “100” is displayed for R, B and G in the digital display section when measurement is

performed in analyzer mode, this indicates that the color of the display measured is the

same as the target color (W) (i.e. the xyLv values are the same) for the selected memory

channel. In the analog display section, only the center green segments light up.

When each display of R, B, G of the digital display part are a same value except for

100, that means the chromaticity coordinate is same as the standard color (W) al
though Lv (Luminance) is different. Even if the intensity of the display changes, the

chromaticity coordinates (x, y) are the same as those of the target color (W) as long as

the values for R, B and G are the same.





**<About G-Standard and R-Standard>**

G-Standard or R-Standard must be chosen according to the display whose white bal
ance is to be adjusted.

    - G-Standard: Must be used for displays whose G output cannot be adjusted

independently.

    - R-Standard: Must be used for displays whose R output cannot be adjusted independently.

- Any of G-standard and R-standard can be used for displays whose R, G and B outputs can be adjusted independently.

**7** **.** **Adjust the white balance.**

Normally, white balance is adjusted by adjusting the cutoff and drive voltages. However, in the procedure

below, the display is adjusted so that the white generated on the display matches the target color (W) stored

in memory.


The method is explained by taking the following cases

where the measured values are as follows compared to the

target color (W).

 - emission intensity of R: Higher by 20%

 - emission intensity of B: Lower by 10%

 - emission intensity of G: Higher by 10%

#### **Measurin Princi le ** **g p**

**1. Measurin** **Princi** **le**
**g** **p**

This instrument uses sensors of a spectral sensitivity similar to the CIE 1931 color-matching function ~~(~~ x ~~λ~~, y ~~λ~~, z λ )
to measure RGB emission energy of a color display, and displays the results in xyLv, T ∆ uvLv, u’v’Lv or XYZ

values.

Measurement is performed in the following sequence.

A RGB emission energy of the color display is acquired through the measuring probe’s receptor, and then

converted to a voltage by the photoelectric conversion section. (Outputs: X, Y, Z)
B The temperature of the probe is detected by the temperature detection section. (Output: T)
C The outputs (X, Y and Z of A ) from the photoelectric conversion section and the output (T of B ) from

the temperature detection section are digitized in the A/D conversion section. A/D conversion is performed simultaneously within the measurement time according to SYNC mode.
D The digitized values (counts) are sent to the instrument’s CPU, where they are calculated according to the

measurement mode, SYNC mode and correction factor (user calibration), which have been set via

the software.

E The processing results are then output to a PC via RS-232C or USB.

Chromaticity coordinates (x, y) for xyLv (CIE 1931 color space) are obtained by the following formula.

**2. About T** ∆ **uvLv**

If the instrument’s measurement mode is set to T ∆ uvLv, the following values can be output.

   - T : Correlated color temperature

   - ∆ uv : Color difference from the blackbody locus

   - Lv : Luminance

In T ∆ uvLv mode, colors are expressed in the correlated color temperature (T) and color difference from the black
body locus ( ∆ uv), and the luminance is expressed in Lv.

**<** **About Correlated Color Temperature T and Color Difference from Blackbody Locus** ∆ **uv** **>**
The temperature of a blackbody (an ideal radiator) that has the same chromaticity coordinates as that of a light is
called the color temperature of that light. However, only the colors that are present along the blackbody locus can
be expressed in color temperatures.

Thus, with a widened concept of color temperature, correlated color temperatures are used to express colors that

are slightly off the blackbody locus.
When a color is on the isotemperature line, the color temperature at the point where that line crosses the blackbody
locus is assumed to be the correlated color temperature of that color. The isotemperature line is the line that is

drawn along the chromaticity coordinates of a collection of colors that you feel visually similar to color temperatures along the blackbody locus.
However, since all the colors on the same isotemperature line are expressed by the same correlated color temperature, it is not possible to express colors using correlated color temperatures only. Thus, to express colors, ∆ uv, that
indicates positional relationship with the correlated color temperature T, is also used.

∆ uv is signed with “+” if the color is located above the blackbody locus, and is signed with “–” if it is below the
blackbody locus.

**3. Princi** **le of User Calibration**
**p**

This instrument uses three detectors provided in the measuring probe’s receptor to measure the colors of the

display.

The spectral sensitivity of these detectors does not match that of CIE 1931 color-matching function perfectly.

Because of this, some colors of the display are affected by slightly shifted spectral sensitivity, resulting in the

situation that absolute values of the measured values differ from the values (true values) obtained when the CIE

1931 color-matching function is used.

By performing user calibration, the influences that occur due to slight differences between the spectral sensitivity

of the detectors used in the instrument and that of CIE 1931 color-matching function can be corrected when

measurement is performed.

(When two or more instruments are used or when the optional 4-Probe Expansion Board CA-B15 is used to use

two or more measuring probes)

Some measuring probes may have a slightly different spectral sensitivity. As a result, even if you are measuring the

same display, measured values may differ from one instrument to another (difference of readings between instru
ments).

Such influences can be corrected by performing user calibration using the same display and the same calibration

values.

This instrument allows one of the user calibration methods; white calibration (single-color calibration) or matrix

calibration (RGB+W calibration).

These user calibration methods have the following features, so the user calibration that best suits your application

must be selected.

**White Calibration**

User’s own correction factor is set to the memory channels by measuring the white color of known values and

setting the obtained calibration values (xyLv) to the instrument. Once this factor is set, the measured values will be

displayed after correction by this factor and output each time measurement is taken.

Performing user calibration provides higher accuracy for measurement of colors that are close to the white color.

**Matrix Calibration**

User’s own matrix correction factor is set to the memory channels by measuring three monochrome colors (R, G

and B) of known values and setting the obtained calibration values (xyLv) and emission characteristic to the

instrument. Once this factor is set, the measured values will be displayed after correction by this factor and output

each time measurement is taken.

Performing matrix calibration enables high-accuracy measurements of displays that provide colors through addi
tive color mixing of three monochrome colors (R, G and B).

Since the matrix correction factor obtained from Konica Minolta’s calibration standard has been set, measured

values calculated based on this factor will be acquired when this instrument is used for the first time since shipment

from the factory.

92



--- PAGE 95 ---

**4. Princi** **le of Anal** **zer Mode**
**p** **y**

In analyzer mode, the emission characteristics of the display’s three monochrome lights (R, G, B) and the target

color are set to the instrument’s memory. Once they are set, display’s screen colors obtained by measurement can

be converted to emission of each monochromatic light and displayed.

For instance, if emission of R among R, G and B is adjusted, only the output of R will change and the outputs of B

and G will remain the same, making white balance adjustment easy (white balance measurement is performed by

adjusting the output of a monochrome color).

Each sensor (spectral sensitivity: **[–]** xλ, [–] yλ, [–] zλ) of the measuring probe has sensitivity towards the display’s R, G and

B. Thus, even if R monochrome light is emitted on the display’s screen, an output will be provided from each
sensor ( [–] xλ, [–] yλ, [–] zλ). This is also true in the case of G and B monochrome colors.

Therefore, to measure each of R, G and B monochrome colors independently, a certain technique is required. In

this instrument’s analyzer mode, measurement is performed based on the following concept.

**<About Principle of Analyzer Mode>**

Fig. 1 shows measuring probe sensor’s spectral sensitivity and display’s R, G and B spectral distributions.

**Fig. 1 Display’s Spectral Distribution and Sensor’s Spectral Sensitivity**

The outputs of sensors **[–]** xλ, [–] yλ, and **[–]** zλ when only the monochrome light R is emitted are the values equivalent to

the hatched areas X R, Y R and Z R, respectively. Although the outputs of these sensors change according to the

output of the monochrome color R, the output ratio will be constant because of the spectral characteristic of the

display and sensors.

**Fig. 2 Outputs of Sensors x** **[–]** **λ** **,** **[–]** **y** **λ** **, and** **[–]** **z** **λ** **by Emitted Monochrome Light R**

93



--- PAGE 96 ---

The above also applies when only monochrome light G is emitted as well as when only monochrome light B is

emitted, and the outputs are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.



**Fig. 4 Outputs of Sensors x** **[–]** **λ** **,** **[–]** **y** **λ** **, and** **[–]** **z** **λ** **by Emitted Monochrome Light B**

By emitting each monochrome light alone and setting the output ratio of each sensor as a constant (correction

factor) to the memory, the output of each monochrome light (R, G, B) can be calculated based on the output of each

sensor, even when three colors are emitted by the display at the same time.

R, G and B are displayed in percentage (%) to each monochrome light of the target color (W), being 100.

Therefore, before performing measurement in analyzer mode, the display’s emission characteristic and target color

(W) must always be set to the instrument’s memory.

In addition, for measurement in analyzer mode, the memory channel to which the same emission characteristic and

target color (W) as those for the display to be measured were set must be used.

**p** **y** **g**

The optical system consists of an objective lens and optical fiber.

Among the lights emitted from the LCD under measurement, only the lights that are emitted at within ±2.5 degrees

(LED Universal Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PSU32/35) and LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35) : ±5

degrees) perpendicular to the LCD are guided by the objective lens to the fiber. After being input to the fiber, the

lights are divided into three portions, and each portion is received by a sensor that has a spectral sensitivity similar

to the CIE 1931 color-matching function. (Three sensors in total).



IEC 61747-6 stipulates the following measuring requirements for LCD evaluation methods.

    - Light receiving angle must be within 5 degrees.

    - The measuring area must consist of 500 pixels or more.

Measuring probe satisfies the above requirements since it employs an optical system that receives only the lights

emitted within ±2.5 degrees from a relatively wide measuring area (φ27).

**6. Princi** **le of Flicker Mode**
**p**

**<What is Flicker?>**

“Blinking“ that appears on the display under certain conditions is called flicker.

This symptom occurs when settings like refresh rate and resolution do not match those set on the display, and in the

case of LCD, it may also occur depending on the displayed colors.

Since flicker occurs periodically, it has an adverse effect on the user’s eyes.

The relationship between the time axis (horizontal) and intensity level (vertical axis) is shown in Fig. 1.

From this, it is obvious that the intensity level changes periodically and the larger its amplitude the more clearly the

flicker is recognized.

In addition, it is known that the frequency of intensity level change is twice as large as that of the display’s vertical

synchronizing signal.

**<Flicker Measurement Method>**

Two kinds of quantifying measurement methods are available: contrast method and JEITA method.

With the CA-310 with LED Flicker Measuring ø27 Probe(CA-P32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/

35) alone, the contrast method is possible. Use of the software supplied with the instrument also allows JEITA

method. This section gives an outline of both quantifying measurement methods.

**(1)Contrast Method**

**Fig. 1**

If the intensity level of the display changes as Fig. 1, it is considered that AC component (b) overlaps on the DC

component (a). With the contrast method, the ratio of AC component to DC component is defined as the flicker

amount.

AC component (a) is defined as Vmax – Vmin and DC component (b) as (Vmax + Vmin)/2, and the flicker amount

is calculated by the following formula.

Flicker amount = AC component / DC component

= (Vmax – Vmin)/{(Vmax + Vmin)/2} ×100 [%]

96



--- PAGE 99 ---

**(2)JEITA Method**

With the contrast method, the amount of flicker does not depend on its frequency, and is calculated based on the

AC and DC components of the measured luminance.

However, human sensitivity to flickering starts to drop gradually at about 30 Hz, and when the frequency exceeds

60 Hz, it is no longer possible for humans to sense it.

**Fig. 2** Frequency Hz

From this, it is possible that even if a flicker of a large amplitude and frequency of 60 Hz or higher exists the human

eye cannot recognize it as a flicker.

Thus, with the JEITA method of flicker measurement, it is very important to know the exact amplitude and fre
quency of flicker energy, in addition to the AC /DC component ratio, that is defined by the contrast method.

With the JEITA method, the measuring devices shown below are required for measurement.

**Fig. 3**

Fig. 3 shows that the output signal (Fig. 1) from the luminance meter (used to measure the LCD) is guided to the

integrator.

To reconstruct what is seen by the human eye, the integrator sends the signal through a filter that decreases the

sensitivity because of frequency difference, and then outputs it to the FFT analyzer.

The signal is processed by the FFT analyzer (Fast Fourier Transform Analyzer), and is displayed in a form of

energy distribution of frequency components (Fig. 4).

As shown in Fig. 4, when two or more frequency components (P0, Px1, Px2) exist, the maximum value among all

the frequency components (Px1, Px2 in the case of Fig. 4) except for P0, that is the component of frequency 0, will

be set as Px. With the JEITA method, the flicker amount in this example is calculated by the following formula.

Flicker amount = 10 × log (Px/P0) [dB]

--- PAGE 102 ---

As shown in the Fig. 5-1, emission intensity of CRT fluctuates in a scanning period of the single frame. CRT emits

light when electronic beam hits phosphor by scanning the screen. But the electronic beam hits the phosphor only

for a moment and phosphor emits maximum light at that time and decreases the intensity gradually. So the emis
sion intensity repeats this variation in a frame.

The reason of the variation is different by type of the display and the intensity of the PDP also fluctuates in the

single frame period. On the other hand, the intensity of the active matrix LCD is stable in the single frame as shown

in the Fig. 5-3.

**<Applicable model of the CA-310 vs. display types>**
The CA-310 with LED Universal Measuring ø27 Probe(CA-PU32/35) or LED Universal Measuring ø10 Probe(CA
PSU32/35) can measure the display devices whose intensity fluctuates such as CRT or PDP. On the other hand,

when using LED Flicker Measuring ø27 Probe(CA-P32/35) or LED Flicker Measuring ø10 Probe(CA-PS32/35)

the CA-310 is limited to be used only for measuring displays whose intensity does not vary in a frame scanning

period as shown in Fig. 5-3. So inaccurate measurement data is sometimes obtained for CRT or PDP with the

CA-P32/35 or CA-PS32/35.

The emission intensity of some types of LCD fluctuates in a scanning period of the single frame. In this case,

inaccurate measurement data is sometimes obtained for even the active matrix LCD with the CA-P32/35 or

CA-PS32/35. Please contact Konica Minolta for more information.

**<"Flicker" measuring function of the CA-310>**
Followings explain how the CA-310 measures "Flicker". When the "Flicker" happens to active matrix LCD that is

stable during single frame scanning period (see Fig. 5-3.), the emission status is as shown in Fig. 6. When the

intensity fluctuates by each frame, human eyes notice it as flicker. "Flicker measuring function of the CA-310

quantifies the amount of this fluctuation. Since the display perception becomes very bad with "Flicker", it is

adjusted to minimum in the LCD manufacturing process.

**Fig. 6 Emission status of LCD with "Flicker"**

Note : The emission of CRT or PDP fluctuates in a frame and such light is called "flickering light" among the display industry.
This "flickering light" and the "Flicker" which is measured by the CA-310 are two different things.

**<Relationship Between Probe Serial No. and Error Message “E1”>**

If “E1” appears, the cause of the error can be located easily by checking the serial no. of the probe used to make

settings and the current probe serial no.

    - Probe serial no. used for making settings : Displayed when the ~~MR~~ key is held down for two to four sec
onds. (The buzzer sounds once immediately after the ~~MR~~ key is

pressed. It will also sound two and four seconds later if the key is

kept held down. Thus, to display the probe serial no. used for

making settings, release the key after the buzzer has sounded

twice in total.)

    - Current probe serial no. : Displayed in the PROBE selection screen when the and

keys are pressed together.
